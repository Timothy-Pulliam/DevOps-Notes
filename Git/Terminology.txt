**HEAD**
The current branch. In more detail: Your working tree is normally derived from the state of the tree referred to by HEAD. HEAD is a reference to one of the heads in your repository, except when using a detached HEAD, in which case it directly references an arbitrary commit.

Below is an image of a detached head when commit-2 was checked out.

It is important to realize that there is only one head, and it only points to one commit at a given point in time. Here it points to the master branch.

**working tree**
The tree of actual checked out files. The working tree normally contains the contents of the HEAD commitâ€™s tree, plus any local changes that you have made but not yet committed.

**dirty**
A working tree is said to be "dirty" if it contains modifications which have not been committed to the current branch.

**stash entry**
An object used to temporarily store the contents of a dirty working directory and the index for future reuse.

**unreachable object**

Unreachable objects are those that are inaccessible by any refs. Any commit that cannot be accessed through a branch or tag is considered unreachable. The git prune command is an internal housekeeping utility that cleans up unreachable or "orphaned" Git objects. git prune is generally not executed directly. Prune is considered a garbage collection command and is a child command of the git gc command.
