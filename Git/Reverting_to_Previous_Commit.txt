====== Reverting to Previous Commit ======
Created Friday 26 April 2019

git checkout <sha>

You will be in a detached head state. If you want to truly delete all commits after this point, you can simply delete the branch, but don't do this, really don't!

Now you can create a new branch from the detached head state

git checkout -b new-master
git branch -D master

If you want to undo the changes to your remote as well, you can force a push using the command below. The "+" forces the push.

git push origin +master
