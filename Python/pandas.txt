==== How are iloc and loc different? ====
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31593201/how-are-iloc-ix-and-loc-different

.loc selects data only by labels

df.loc['Penelope']
df.loc[['Cornelia', 'Jane', 'Dean']]
df.loc['Aaron':'Dean']

.iloc selects data only by integer location

df.iloc[4]

df.iloc[[2, -2]]
This returns a DataFrame of the third and second to last rows:

df.iloc[:5:3]

Simultaneous selection of rows and columns with .loc and .iloc

One excellent ability of both .loc/.iloc is their ability to select both rows and columns simultaneously. In the examples above, all the columns were returned from each selection. We can choose columns with the same types of inputs as we do for rows. We simply need to separate the row and column selection with a comma.

For example, we can select rows Jane, and Dean with just the columns height, score and state like this:

df.loc[['Jane', 'Dean'], 'height':]
