In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector that changes by only a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. More formally, if T is a linear transformation from a vector space V over a field F into itself and v is a vector in V that is not the zero vector, then v is an eigenvector of T if T(v) is a scalar multiple of v. This condition can be written as the equation

{\displaystyle T(\mathbf {v} )=\lambda \mathbf {v} ,} {\displaystyle T(\mathbf {v} )=\lambda \mathbf {v} ,}

where λ is a scalar in the field F, known as the eigenvalue, characteristic value, or characteristic root associated with the eigenvector v.

If the vector space V is finite-dimensional, then the linear transformation T can be represented as a square matrix A, and the vector v by a column vector, rendering the above mapping as a matrix multiplication on the left-hand side and a scaling of the column vector on the right-hand side in the equation
{\displaystyle A\mathbf {v} =\lambda \mathbf {v} .}

Equation (1) can be stated equivalently as

This has a non-zero solution v if and only if the determinant of the matrix (A − λI) is zero. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A are values of λ that satisfy the equation

The fundamental theorem of algebra implies that the characteristic polynomial of an n-by-n matrix A, being a polynomial of degree n, can be factored into the product of n linear terms,

where each λi may be real but in general is a complex number. The numbers λ1, λ2, … λn, which may not all have distinct values, are roots of the polynomial and are the eigenvalues of A.
