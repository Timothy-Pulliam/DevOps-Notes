====== Probability ======
Created Monday 06 May 2019

Classical Method of Assigning Probabilities

P(E) = n/N

E = Event
n = number of times event can occur
N = total number of events

0 <= P(E) <= 1

Probability of Relative Frequency of Occurrence

(Number of times Event has occurred) / (Number of Times Event could have occurred)


Sample Space - Complete list of all elementary events for an experiment. For example, the sample space for rolling two dice is

== General Rules ==
intersect(A,B) = intersect(B,A)


== Addition ==
P(X U Y) = P(X) + P(Y) - intersection(X,Y)

if X and Y are disjoint, intersection(X,Y) = 0
P(X U Y) = P(X) + P(Y)

== Multiplication ==
intersection(X, Y) = P(X) * P(Y|X) = P(Y) * P(X|Y)

If X and Y are independant events
intersection(X, Y) = P(X) * P(Y) = P(Y) * P(X)

== Law of Conditional Probability ==
{{.\pasted_image008.png}}=  P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B)
where {{.\pasted_image009.png}}  is the probability that both events A and B occur. This may be visualized as restricting the sample space to situations in which B occurs. The logic behind this equation is that if the possible outcomes for A and B are restricted to those in which B occurs, this set serves as the new sample space.

{{.\pasted_image010.png}}
If B1 occurs, A must occur.

== Bayes' Theorem ==
{{.\pasted_image011.png}}

To calculate the probability of the intersection of more than two events, the conditional probabilities of all of the preceding events must be considered. In the case of three events, A, B, and C, the probability of the intersection P(A and B and C) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A and B).

Mutually Exclusive Events occur when the intersection of both events is zero. For example, when testing a lightbulb, it can either "PASS" or "FAIL", but not both (XOR).

== Complement ==
{{.\pasted_image004.png}}

{{.\pasted_image005.png}}

The probability of the complement
	''P(X') = 1 - P(X)''


== Independant Events ==
If two events are independant of one another, we can say the following

''P(X|Y) = P(X) 	and 	P(Y|X) = P(Y)''

* P(X|Y) = the probability of X occurring, given that Y has already occurred.

Knowing that Y has occurred does not impact the probability of X occurring if the two events are independant. For example. 

* Y = The lakers are playing today
* X = I will pet my cat

These things are not related. Usually, when you sample from a population, you must replace the sample and "shuffle" the population to avoid effecting future events. 

For example if you have a batch of screws that are 5% defective and you take one out at random, if you do not replace the screw back into the population and shuffle, the next screw you pick will have a chance slightly less than 5% of being defective. The events are no longer independant.

{{.\pasted_image006.png}}

You always have fewer combinations than permutations, and here’s why:
Take the numbers 1,2,3,4. If you want to know how many ways you can select 3 items where the order doesn’t matter (and the items aren’t allowed to repeat), you can pick:

123
234
134
124
However, if you want permutations (where the order does matter, the same set has 24 different possibilities. Just take the first set of numbers listed above {1,2,3} and think of the ways you can order it.

123
132
321
312
231
213
There are six ways to order the numbers, which means there are 4 x 6 ways to order the set of four numbers.
