e = lim x -> inf (1 + 1/x)^x

prove, (1 + a)^b = e^ab if a is small

Taylor Series

When
x is large, the above series converges slowly, although it does converge because
n! grows faster than x^n
for any constant x. However, when x is small, either
positive or negative, the series converges rapidly, and only a few terms are
necessary to get a good approximation.


==== Power Laws ====
one quantity varies as a power of another. For instance, considering the area of a square in terms of the length of its side, if the length is doubled, the area is multiplied by a factor of four.

y = x^2

log2(y) = 2log2(x)

General form

y = Cx^a
y = e^b * x^a

where b is some constant and C = e^b

ln(y) = ln(e^b) + ln(x^a)
ln(y) = b + ln(x^a)

In the example below, instead of using natural logs, we use log base 10. so

* C = 10^6
* a = -2

y = 10^6 * x**-2
