== Minkowski Metric ==
Minkowski distance is typically used with p being 1 or 2, which correspond to the Manhattan distance and the Euclidean distance, respectively. In the limiting case of p reaching infinity, we obtain the Chebyshev distance:

The Minkowski distance of order p between two points

Is defined as

== Manhattan Distance ==
When n = 2 (2-dimensions) and P = 1, this simplifies to the Manhattan Distance.

points: (y1,y2), (x1,x2)
Horizontal distance: x1-y1
Vertical Distance: x2-y2
Total Distance = (x1 + x2) - (y1 + y2)

Red: **Manhattan distance**. Green: diagonal, straight-line distance. Red, blue, yellow: equivalent Manhattan distances.

== Example ==

p can intuitively be thought of as the number of dimensions that can be traversed at any given moment in "time"

The distances between the x,y vectors, using the Euclidean Distance is found below.

'''
from math import sqrt

x = [1,1,1,1,0]
y = [1,0,1,0,4]

def euclideanDistance(x,y):
    distance = sqrt( sum( [ abs( i-j ) for i,j in zip(x,y)]))
    return distance

euclideanDistance(x,y)
