== Minkowski Metric ==
Minkowski distance is typically used with p being 1 or 2, which correspond to the Manhattan distance and the Euclidean distance, respectively. In the limiting case of p reaching infinity, we obtain the Chebyshev distance:

The Minkowski distance of order p between two points

== Manhattan Distance ==
When n = 2 (2-dimensions) and P = 1, this simplifies to the Manhattan Distance.

points: (y1,y2), (x1,x2)
Horizontal distance: x1-y1
Vertical Distance: x2-y2
Total Distance = (x1 + x2) - (y1 + y2)
