==== Perceptron Neurons ====
Limitations
* Only works for data sets which are linear separable.
{{./pasted_image008.png}}

* We don't necessarily know if a data set is linearly separable.
* halting problem

{{./pasted_image.png}}

* Two Classes (-1,1) either neuron fired or it didn't.
* Activation Function {{./equation002.png?type=equation}} takes a linear combination of sample vectors with corresponding weight functions
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}

{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}
* {{./equation006.png?type=equation}} = Defined activation threshold

This results in the following heavyside step function, the activation of of a linear combination of samples.

If we define 

{{./equation007.png?type=equation}}

We can rewite as

== The Algorithm ==
{{./pasted_image009.png}}

1) Initialize the weights ({{./equation009.png?type=equation}}) to 0, or small random numbers
2) For each training sample ({{./equation010.png?type=equation}}) perform the following steps
	1) Compute output value prediction {{./equation011.png?type=equation}} (-1, or 1)
	2) update weights using the following method
