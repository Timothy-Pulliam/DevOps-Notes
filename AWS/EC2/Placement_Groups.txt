====== Placement Groups ======
Created Tuesday 31 July 2018

The same image should be used for all instances in a placement group.

==== Types of Placement Groups ====
* Clustered (more common)
* Spread

== Clustered Placement Groups ==
A grouping of instances **within a single Availability Zone** (subnet). Placement Groups are recommended for applications that need low network latency, high network throughput, or both (big data clusters). Only certain instances can be launched into a clustered placement group.

* Instances can't span multiple AZs

==== Spread Placement Groups ====
A grouping of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying hardware. This provides extra redundancy for applications in case one instance goes down. Recommeneded for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept physical separate (redundant) from one another.

Instances within Spread Placement Groups will be in multiple AZs, on different hardware. Thus they are the opposite of Clustered Placement Groups.

* Instances can span multiple AZs (usually do)
