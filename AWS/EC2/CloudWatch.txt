====== CloudWatch ======
Created Friday 27 July 2018

[[CloudWatch]] monitors the CPU, RAM, Network, Disk I/O etc, of your EC2 instances. You can create custom dashboards which display custom graph and reporting widgets. Dashboards configs use markdown syntax.

Standard Monitoring - Interval is every 5 minutes
Detailed Monitoring - Interval is every 1 minute

== System vs Instance Checks ==
System check is a check on the hypervisor running the EC2 instance. If the System check fails, there is really nothing you can do. Maybe try spinning up a new VM in another Availability Zone. If the Instance check fails, you can try just rebooting the Instance, or spinning up a new Instance.
