====== Bucket Operations ======
Created Wednesday 04 July 2018

==== Create Buckets ====
Buckets are managed globally. Buckets must have a unique name, as they are managed in a global AWS DNS directory.

We can tag buckets and we can tag objects in the buckets. **Objects do NOT inherit bucket tags**.

Minimum Object size = 0 Bytes

Click "Create Bucket". Provide a unique name that can be used for a DNS compliant name for your S3 bucket. Note that buckets are region specific.

== Bucket Tagging ==
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-tagging.html
Tagging can be useful for organizing buckets into categories. For example, you may have test, dev, QA, Staging and Prod buckets. You may have buckets containing sensitive information, or that need to be HIPPA compliant that you want to label as such. You could label your buckets like the following example. **Note** that objects stored in buckets do not inherit the buckets tags.

== Bucket Tags vs. Metadata ==

==== Bucket Properties / Permissions ====
By default, the contents of buckets are not viewable by anyone except the owner. The owner is able to modify (read, write, delete) objects in this bucket (1) as well as the permissions for those objects (2)

If you make a bucket public (grant public read permissions) anyone can navigate to the bucket's URL in a web browser and view it's contents. For example, if we had a public bucket named "linuxandchill-tokyo" with a single object, we could see it like so.

It is important to note, that even though a bucket is public, this does not allow you to view the objects inside of the bucket. Public read access for buckets only allows you to view the contents of buckets (much like read access for linux directories). We can see this by trying to view the **bw-pier.jpg** object in the bucket. Even the bucket itself is public, the object is not public (not readable). Thus we get access denied.

Making the bucket private again denies any person in the world from listing out the contents of the bucket. Instead, they get am access denied code.

==== Uploading Files to the bucket ====
You should now see the S3 bucket in the dashboard. Click on the bucket name and then click "Upload". You will be given an option of Storage Tier (Standard, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, etc.) As well as encryption. You can also tag the object, or give the object custom metadata. In the example below, I have uploaded some text documents and source code. I tagged the objects with "source=True"

 Even if you upload more than one file (object) at a time, you will get the following message informing you of a single success. Multiple files uploaded count as a single transaction.

==== Object Permissions ====

If you click on the URL for the object and you get the following page, you do not have permissions to read the object.

==== Delete Buckets ====

Click on the bucket you wish to delete, then click "Delete bucket". However, keep in mind the following.

* Bucket names are unique. If you delete this bucket, another AWS user can use the name.
* This bucket is not empty. If you delete it, all the objects in the bucket will also be deleted.
* Based on the number of objects in your bucket, this may take some time. Please do not close your browser window before the process is completed.
