====== Kinesis ======
Created Wednesday 01 August 2018

==== Overview ====
Kinesis can be used to take in streaming data and analyze the data to find patterns. For example, you can analyze twitter (social media) feeds (streaming source) from thousands of people to predict if people find a particular product favorable or not. 

Kinesis is used to handle streaming data. It allows you load and analyze streaming data.

Streaming data is data that is generated continuously by thousands of data sources, which typically send in the data records simultaneously and in small sizes (KBs).

Examples of streaming data

* Purchases from online stores (amazon.com)
* stock prices
* online gaming (COD, angry birds)
* social network (facebook)
* geospatial data (uber, google maps, waze)
* [[IoT]] sensor data (temperature data)

==== Core Kinesis Services ====
* Kinesis Streams
* Kinesis Firehose
* Kinesis Analytics

==== Kinesis Streams ====
Streaming data is generated by producers (ec2 instances, smart phone, pc, IoT, etc.). The streaming data is analyzed by Kinesis Streams and stored temporarily in shards. Kinesis Streams can store the data from 24hrs to 7days max. The data is then stored long term in a database or by other means (s3, etc.)

==== Kinesis Firehose ====



==== Kineses Analytics ====
Basically allows you to run SQL queries against the data in Kinesis Streams/Firehose and store the output in S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch Cluster etc. Allows you to analyze data using SQL.
