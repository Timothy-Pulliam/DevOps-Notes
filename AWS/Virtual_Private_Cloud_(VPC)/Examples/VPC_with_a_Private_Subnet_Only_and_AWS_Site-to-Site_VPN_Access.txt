====== VPC with a Private Subnet Only and AWS Site-to-Site VPN Access ======
Created Friday 26 April 2019


https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario4.html

The configuration for this scenario includes a virtual private cloud (VPC) with a single private subnet, and a virtual private gateway to enable communication with your own network over an IPsec VPN tunnel. There is no Internet gateway to enable communication over the Internet. We recommend this scenario if you want to extend your network into the cloud using Amazon's infrastructure without exposing your network to the Internet.

This scenario can also be optionally configured for IPv6â€”you can use the VPC wizard to create a VPC and subnet with associated IPv6 CIDR blocks. Instances launched into the subnet can receive IPv6 addresses. __Currently, we do not support IPv6 communication over a AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection; however, instances in the VPC can communicate with each other via IPv6.__
