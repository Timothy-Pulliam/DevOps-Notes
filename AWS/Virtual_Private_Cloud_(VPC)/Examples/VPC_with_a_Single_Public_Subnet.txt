====== VPC with a Single Public Subnet ======
Created Wednesday 17 April 2019

The configuration for this scenario includes a virtual private cloud (VPC) with a single public subnet, and an Internet gateway to enable communication over the Internet. We recommend this configuration if you need to run a single-tier, public-facing web application, such as a blog or a simple website.

* The configuration for this scenario includes the following:
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) with a size /16 IPv4 CIDR block (example: 10.0.0.0/16). This provides 65,536 private IPv4 addresses.
* A subnet with a size /24 IPv4 CIDR block (example: 10.0.0.0/24). This provides 256 private IPv4 addresses.
* An Internet gateway. This connects the VPC to the Internet and to other AWS services.
* An instance with a private IPv4 address in the subnet range (example: 10.0.0.6), which enables the instance to communicate with other instances in the VPC, and an Elastic IPv4 address (example: 198.51.100.2), which is a public IPv4 address that enables the instance to be reached from the Internet.
* A custom route table associated with the subnet. The route table entries enable instances in the subnet to use IPv4 to communicate with other instances in the VPC, and to communicate directly over the Internet. A subnet that's associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet gateway is known as a public subnet.

You can optionally enable IPv6 for this scenario. In addition to the components listed above, the configuration includes the following:

* A size /56 IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC (example: 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56). Amazon automatically assigns the CIDR; you cannot choose the range yourself.
* A size /64 IPv6 CIDR block associated with the public subnet (example: 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64). You can choose the range for your subnet from the range allocated to the VPC. You cannot choose the size of the subnet IPv6 CIDR block.
* An IPv6 address assigned to the instance from the subnet range (example: 2001:db8:1234:1a00::123).
* Route table entries in the custom route table that enable instances in the VPC to use IPv6 to communicate with each other, and directly over the Internet.
