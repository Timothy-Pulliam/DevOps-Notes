====== VPC with Public and Private Subnets (NAT) ======
Created Tuesday 16 April 2019

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html
The configuration for this scenario includes a virtual private cloud (VPC) with a public subnet and a private subnet. We recommend this scenario if you want to run a public-facing web application, while maintaining back-end servers that aren't publicly accessible. A common example is a multi-tier website, with the web servers in a public subnet and the database servers in a private subnet. You can set up security and routing so that the web servers can communicate with the database servers.

The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the Internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet can't. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the Internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet. The database servers can connect to the Internet for software updates using the NAT gateway, but the Internet cannot establish connections to the database servers.

This scenario can also be optionally configured for IPv6â€”you can use the VPC wizard to create a VPC and subnets with associated IPv6 CIDR blocks. Instances launched into the subnets can receive IPv6 addresses, and communicate using IPv6. Instances in the private subnet can use an egress-only Internet gateway to connect to the Internet over IPv6, but the Internet cannot establish connections to the private instances over IPv6.

Anything with a public IP is in the Public Subnet

Instances with private IPv4 addresses in the subnet range (examples: 10.0.0.5, 10.0.1.5). This enables them to communicate with each other and other instances in the VPC.

A NAT gateway with its own Elastic IPv4 address. Instances in the private subnet can send requests to the Internet through the NAT gateway over IPv4 (for example, for software updates).


==== Overview for IPv6 ====

You can optionally enable IPv6 for this scenario. In addition to the components listed above, the configuration includes the following:
