====== Internet vs NAT Gateways ======
Created Tuesday 16 April 2019

==== Internet Gateways ====
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html

If your subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, it's known as a public subnet.

Internet gateways are free to use

APIs
aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --vpc-id "vpc-097a87ebab1cb2662" --internet-gateway-id "igw-0d3732a7fa8e34862" --region us-east-2

== NAT Gateways ==
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html
You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.

The main route table sends internet traffic from the instances in the private subnet to the NAT gateway. The NAT gateway sends the traffic to the internet gateway using the NAT gateway’s Elastic IP address as the source IP address.

NAT gateways are not supported for IPv6 traffic—use an egress-only internet gateway instead.

You are charged for creating and using a NAT gateway in your account. NAT gateway hourly usage and data processing rates apply. Amazon EC2 charges for data transfer also apply.
