====== Elastic IP Addresses ======
Created Friday 26 April 2019

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html

An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the internet. If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet; for example, to connect to your instance from your local computer.

We currently do not support Elastic IP addresses for IPv6.


== Elastic IP Address Basics ==

* An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific region only.

* To ensure efficient use of Elastic IP addresses, we impose a small hourly charge if an Elastic IP address is not associated with a running instance, or if it is associated with a stopped instance or an unattached network interface. While your instance is running, you are not charged for one Elastic IP address associated with the instance, but you are charged for any additional Elastic IP addresses associated with the instance. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Pricing.

* When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or its primary network interface, the instance's public IPv4 address (if it had one) is released back into Amazon's pool of public IPv4 addresses.

* When you allocate an Elastic IP address from an IP address pool that you have brought to your AWS account, it does not count toward your Elastic IP address limits.

== Limits ==

By default, all AWS accounts are limited to five (5) Elastic IP addresses per region, because public (IPv4) internet addresses are a scarce public resource. We strongly encourage you to use an Elastic IP address primarily for the ability to remap the address to another instance in the case of instance failure, and to use DNS hostnames for all other inter-node communication.
