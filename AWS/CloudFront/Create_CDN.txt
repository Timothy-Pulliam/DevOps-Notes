====== Create CDN ======
Created Sunday 08 July 2018

Create a bucket named linuxandchill-tokyo in the tokyo region. Place a jpeg image in the bucket. Accessing the bucket via the S3 URL gives the following times.

If this is your first CDN, you will see the following landing page. Click on "Create Distribution"

{{./pasted_image001.png}}

We are creating a web distribution. The **Origin Domain Name** in this case is the S3 Bucket.

You may want to optionally restrict viewer access by having users authenticate themselves. Note, TTL is in seconds and the default TTL is one day (24 hours)

Lastly, select your price class and enable the CDN.

We can see our distribution is in progress. It will take about 10-15 minutes for the distribution to be created.

Now we can see the time it takes to retrieve the resource as decreased significantly by accessing the bucket via the cloudfront URL.

We can also verify we are using cloudfront by issuing a CURL command.
