Created Sunday 15 July 2018

==== EBS Volume Types ====
General Purpose (SSD) volumes can burst to 3000 IOPS, and deliver a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GiB. Provisioned IOPs (SSD) volumes can deliver up to 32,000 IOPS, and are best for EBS-optimized instances. Magnetic volumes, previously called standard volumes, deliver 100 IOPS on average, and can burst to hundreds of IOPS.

* General Purpose SSD (GP2)
	* balances price and performance
	* 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3000IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at 3334GiB and above
* Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
	* I/O instensive applications such as large relational or [[NoSL]] databases
	* used if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
	* can provision up to 20,000 IPOS per volume
* Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
	* Big Data
	* Data Warehouse
	* Log Processing
	* Cannot be a boot volumen
* Cold HDD (SC1)
	* Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed data
	* cannot be a boot volume
	* file server
* Magnetic (standard)
	* Lowest cost per GB of all EBS volume types that is bootable.
	* Ideal for workloads that are accessed infrequently
	* cheap
