====== Lambda ======
Created Monday 02 July 2018

==== Overview ====
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.

"Serverless Computing". You just write the code and upload it, and Lambda runs it based on a triggering event. You don't have to worry about setting up and administrating virtual machines or databases.
