====== CI CD ======
Created Monday 15 April 2019

Terminology:

Immutable Infrastructure: 
It is expensive, time-consuming, and often boring to fix a server. So why fix a server when you can just throw it away and build a new one?


Use Spot Instances for non critical tasks (compilation, testing) to save up to 90% over on demand instances.

== Code Deploy / Code Pipeline ==

==== Deployment Types ====

==== Single Target Deployment ====

Basically, your QA system is your Prod system. Think writing code on your laptop and pushing to a single server. You really can only test on that one server, which limits you in terms the types of tests you can do, and downtime.

==== All-at-Once Deployment ====

Downside is if you break something, you break everything.

==== Rolling Deployment ====
Slow to deploy/rollback. However very reliable as health checks are made at each stage for each group of servers.

==== "Blue Green" / A B Deployment ====
Very quick to roll back. Just a DNS change is needed.

1) Our app exists in its own domain
2) We clone the entire infrastructure using Cloud Formation
3) Build/Deploy new application to cloned infrastructure
4) If a health check passes on clone, we switch DNS to point to the new application.

==== A B Testing ====

A B Testing is implemented via Route 53
