====== Cost Optimization ======
Created Thursday 18 April 2019

== Terminology ==
**IT Chargeback/Showback** - IT chargeback is an accounting strategy that applies the costs of IT hardware, software, cloud services or shared services to the business unit in which they are used. IT showback is similar to IT chargeback, but the prices are for informational purposes only and no one is billed.

==== Cost Optimization Pillars ====

Regardless of your workload or architecture, there are five cost optimization pillars that apply across nearly all environments. The pillars of cost optimization are:

* **Right size** – Ensure that what you provision matches what you need. For example, for compute, you provision for CPU, memory, storage, and network throughput.

* **Increase elasticity** – Traditional IT costs and hardware requirements are tailored for peak usage and are rarely turned off. In the cloud, you can optimize cost to meet dynamic needs and turn resources off when they are not needed. For example, you can usually turn off non-production instances for 70% or more of any given week.

* **Leverage the right pricing model** – AWS provides a range of pricing models (On-Demand and Spot Instances for variable workloads and Reserved Instances for predictable workloads). Choose the right pricing model to optimize costs based on the nature of your workload.

* **Optimize storage** – AWS provides multiple storage tiers at prices designed to meet performance. By identifying the most appropriate destination for specific types of data, you can reduce Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) while maintaining the required performance and availability. For example, where performance requirements are lower, using Amazon EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) storage typically costs half as much as the default General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage option.

* **Measure, monitor, and improve** – To ensure that you extract the full economic potential of the AWS Cloud at any scale, you want to:
	* Define and enforce cost allocation tagging.
	* Define metrics, set targets, and review at a reasonable cadence.
	* Enable teams to architect for cost via training, visualization of progress goals, and a balance of incentives.
	* Assign optimization responsibility to an individual or to a team.


==== Tagging to Support Cost Ownership ====

An effective tagging strategy will give you improved visibility and monitoring, help you create accurate chargeback/showback models, and get more granular and precise insights into usage and spend by applications and teams. The following tag categories can help you achieve these goals:

**Environment** – Distinguishes between development, test, and production infrastructure. Specifying an environment tag reduces analysis time, post-processing, and the need to maintain a separate mapping file of production versus non-production accounts.

**Application ID** – Identifies resources that are related to a specific application for easy tracking of spend change and turn-off at the end of projects.

**Automation Opt-In/Opt-Out** – Indicates whether a resource should be included in an automated activity such as starting, stopping, or resizing instances.

**Cost Center/Business Unit** – Identifies the cost center or business unit associated with a resource, typically for cost allocation and tracking.

**Owner** – Used to identify who is responsible for the resource. This is typically the technical owner. If needed, you can add a separate business owner tag. You can specify the owner as an email address. Using an email address supports automated notifications to both the technical and business owners as required (e.g., if the resource is a candidate for elasticity or right sizing).

== Enforce Quality of Tagging ==
Without enforcement, tagging quality will be low, and reporting will be manual, time-consuming, and subject to debate. There are two general types of tagging enforcement: soft and hard. Soft enforcement notifies users when they have not followed policies. Hard enforcement terminates resources that are not tagged to the company standard (usually within hours after they’re launched). Mature organizations find hard enforcement of tagging to be the best way to ensure that quality tagging is maintained.
