==== Key Principles ====
There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer.

**Outbound Data Transfer**
In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS
services within the same region. There are some exceptions, so be sure to verify data transfer rates
before beginning.

Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the
outbound data transfer rate. This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out. 

**Compute**
For compute resources, you pay hourly from the time you launch a resource until the time you terminate it

**Data Storage/Transfer**
you typically pay per GB. 

**Taxes**

==== Cost Optimization Strategies ====

== Right Sizing (The Obvious Solution) ==
https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/cost-optimization/#right-size
With AWS you can right size your services to meet exactly the capacity requirements you need without having to overprovision or compromise capacity.
With AWS, you can adapt your services to address actual business needs at any time, with **no penalties or incidental fees**.

Use the right 
* EC2 Instance type
* RDS Instance type
* AWS storage class

to avoid over-paying

== Use The Right Pricing Model ==
AWS offers several pricing models depending on product. These include:

* On Demand means you pay for compute or database capacity with no long-term commitments
or upfront payments.
* Dedicated Instances (available with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)) run in a
virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that’s dedicated to a single customer.
* Spot Instances are an Amazon EC2 pricing mechanism that lets you purchase spare computing
capacity with no upfront commitment at discounted hourly rates.
* Reservations provide you with the ability to receive a greater discount, up to 75 percent, by
paying for capacity ahead of time. More detail is provided in the section, “Optimizing costs with
reservations.” Reservation options include:
