==== Key Principles ====
There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer.

**Outbound Data Transfer**
In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS
services within the same region. There are some exceptions, so be sure to verify data transfer rates
before beginning.

Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the
outbound data transfer rate. This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out. 

**Compute**
For compute resources, you pay hourly from the time you launch a resource until the time you terminate it

**Data Storage/Transfer**
you typically pay per GB. 

**No Taxes (Except Japan)**

sales tax.

==== Cost Optimization Strategies ====

== Right Sizing ==
https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/cost-optimization/#right-size
With AWS you can right size your services to meet exactly the capacity requirements you need without having to overprovision or compromise capacity.
With AWS, you can adapt your services to address actual business needs at any time, with **no penalties or incidental fees**.

Use the right 
* EC2 Instance type
* RDS Instance type
* AWS storage class

to avoid over-paying

== Reserved Instances (RIs) ==
For certain services like Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS, you can invest in reserved capacity. 
With Reserved Instances, you can save up to 75% over equivalent on-demand capacity. Reserved Instances are available in 3 options â€“ 
* All up-front (AURI)
* Partial up-front (PURI) 
* No upfront payments (NURI).

When you buy Reserved Instances, the larger the upfront payment, the greater the discount. To maximize your savings, you can pay all up-front and receive the  largest discount. Partial up-front RI's offer lower discounts but give you the option to spend less up front. Lastly, you can choose to spend nothing up front and receive a smaller discount, but allowing you to free up capital to spend in other projects.

By using reserved capacity, your organization can minimize risks, more predictably manage budgets, and comply with policies that require longer-term commitments.

After you are done with your RI, you can sell it on the RI market place.
