====== Billing Alarm with CloudWatch ======
Created Tuesday 03 July 2018

Create a billing alarm so that you can receive an email if your AWS resources start to cost more than a certain amount. This will help you avoid going beyond your expected monthly bill. Billing data is sent to Cloud Watch and an alarm is triggered when spending reaches a custom set threshold. You can then see which AWS resources are costing the most and scale them down accordingly.

Click on your name in the top right corner, and select "My Billing Dashboard"

Enable billing alerts. You must be signed in using AWS account root user credentials; IAM users cannot enable billing alerts for your AWS account.

Note: Once you enable billing alerts, you cannot turn them off.

After we enable billing alerts and save our preferences, click on "Manage Billing Alerts". This will take us to CloudWatch, the monitoring microservice. Click on "Alarms > Billing" and we can set up our billing alarms.

Click on "Create Alarm". Below, I set an alarm to send me an email when my monthly AWS charges exceed $10/month. You will then be prompted to verify the email is legit.

It takes a couple minutes for [[CloudWatch]] to start gathering billing data. Until then, you will see "Insufficient Data". After that you should see the following
