====== Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) ======
Created Monday 02 July 2018

== Terminology ==
* **A Virtual Private Cloud**: A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud. You define a VPC’s IP address space from ranges you select.
* **Subnet**: A segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources. Subnets cannot span multiple AZs.
* **Internet Gateway**: The Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public Internet.
* **NAT Gateway**: A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources __in a private subnet__ to access the Internet.
* **Virtual private gateway**: The Amazon VPC side of a VPN connection.
* **Peering Connection**: A peering connection enables you to route traffic via private IP addresses between two peered VPCs.
* **VPC Endpoints**: Enables private connectivity to services hosted in AWS, from within your VPC without using an Internet Gateway, VPN, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or firewall proxies.
	* **Gateway type endpoints** are available only for AWS services including S3 and DynamoDB. These endpoints will add an entry to your route table you selected and route the traffic to the supported services through Amazon’s private network.
	* **Interface type endpoints** provide private connectivity to services powered by PrivateLink, being AWS services, your own services or SaaS solutions, and supports connectivity over Direct Connect. More AWS and SaaS solutions will be supported by these endpoints in the future. Please refer to VPC Pricing for the price of interface type endpoints.
* **Egress-only Internet Gateway**: A stateful gateway to provide egress only access for IPv6 traffic from the VPC to the Internet.

== Default VPC ==

You can create a default VPC in an Availability Zone via AWS API

''$ aws ec2 create-default-subnet --availability-zone us-east-2a''

When we create a default VPC, we do the following to set it up for you:

* Create a VPC with a size /16 IPv4 CIDR block (172.31.0.0/16). This provides up to 65,536 private IPv4 addresses.
* Create a size /20 default subnet in each Availability Zone. This provides up to 4,096 addresses per subnet, a few of which are reserved for our use.
* Create an **internet gateway** and connect it to your default VPC.
* Create a default security group and associate it with your default VPC.
* Create a default network access control list (ACL) and associate it with your default VPC.
* Associate the default DHCP options set for your AWS account with your default VPC.

You can get more information about a VPC using the following command

''$ aws ec2 describe-vpcs --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d''

==== Elastic IP ====
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html

An Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. You can associate an Elastic IP address with any instance or network interface for any VPC in your account. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your VPC. Note that the advantage of associating the Elastic IP address with the network interface instead of directly with the instance is that you can move all the attributes of the network interface from one instance to another in a single step.

We currently do not support Elastic IP addresses for IPv6.

You're limited to five Elastic IP addresses
