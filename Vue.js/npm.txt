Where does npm put stuff?
	   See npm help 5 npm-folders

	   tl;dr:

	   - Non-global libraries are installed the node_modules sub folder in the folder you are currently in. Use the npm root command to see where modules go, and the npm bin command to see where executables go

	   -   Global installs are different from local installs. If you install  something  with  the  -g
		   flag, then its executables go in **npm bin -g** and its modules go in **npm root -g**.
