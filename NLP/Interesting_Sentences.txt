PERCEPTION

==== Regarding the Definitions of words ====
We  could try to define a word as a "sound with meaning", however there are two problems.

First, this does not distinguish words from sentences, which are also sounds with meaning.

Second, a word such as it in a sentence such as It is snowing
has no meaning. The word is simply a placeholder for the subject position
of the sentence. Therefore, not all sound sequences are words, and not all
sound sequences that native speakers would identify as words have a
meaning. We have intuitions about what is and is not a word in our na-
tive language, but as yet we do not have an adequate definition for the
term word.

==== Subject before Object ====
The subject of an English sentence typically precedes the
verb and the object typically follows it, as in John read the book.
