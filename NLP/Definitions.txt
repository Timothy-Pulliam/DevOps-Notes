==== The Linguistic "Stack" ====
1. Phonetic/Phonological information. For every word we know, we
have learned a pronunciation. Part of knowing the word tree is knowing
certain sounds—more precisely, a certain sequence of sounds. Phonetics
and phonology are the subfields of linguistics that study the structure and
systematic patterning of sounds in human language (see chapters 3 and
4).

2. Lexical structure information. For every word we have learned, we
intuitively know something about its internal structure. For example,
our intuitions tell us that the word tree cannot be broken down into any
meaningful parts. In contrast, the word trees seems to be made up of two
parts: the word tree plus an additional element, -s (known as the ‘‘plural’’
ending). Morphology is the subfield of linguistics that studies the internal
structure of words and the relationships among words.

3. Syntactic information. For every word we learn, we learn how it fits
into the overall structure of sentences in which it can be used. For exam-
14 Chapter 2
ple, we know that the word reads can be used in a sentence like Mark
reads the book, and the word readable (related to the word read ) can be
used in a sentence like The book is readable. We may not know that read
is called a verb or that readable is called an adjective; but we intuitively
know, as native speakers, how to use those words in di¤erent kinds of
sentences. Syntax is the subfield of linguistics that studies the internal
structure of sentences and the relationships among their component parts
(see chapter 5).

4. Semantic information. For virtually every word we know, we have
learned a meaning or several meanings. For example, to know the word
brother is to know that it has a certain meaning (the equivalent of ‘‘male
sibling’’). In addition, we may or may not know certain extended mean-
ings of the word, as in John is so friendly and helpful, he’s a regular
brother to me. Semantics is the subfield of linguistics that studies the
nature of the meaning of individual words, and the meaning of words
grouped into phrases and sentences (see chapter 6).

5. Pragmatic information. For every word we learn, we know not only
its meaning or meanings but also how to use it in the context of discourse
or conversation. For instance, the word brother can be used not only to
refer to a male sibling but also as a conversational exclamation, as in
‘‘Oh brother! What a mess!’’ In some cases, words seem to have a use
but no meaning as such. For example, the word hello is used to greet,
but it seems to have no meaning beyond that particular use. Pragmatics
is the subfield of linguistics that studies the use of words (and phrases
and sentences) in the actual context of discourse (see chapter 9).

==== Corpus / Corpora ====
Corpora are collections of related documents that contain natural language.

== Lexicon ==
The list of words for any language (though not a complete list, as we will see) is referred to as its lexicon.

== Morpheme ==

{{./pasted_image001.png}}



Morphemes are categorized into two classes: free morphemes and bound morphemes.

* A free morpheme can stand alone as an independent word in a phrase, such as the word tree in John sat in the tree.

* A bound morpheme cannot stand alone but must be attached to another morpheme—
like, for example, the plural morpheme -s, which can only occur attached
to nouns, or cran-, which must be combined with berry (or, more recently,
with apple, grape, or some other fruit)

== Free Morpheme ==
tree
hello
tim

== prefixes ==
re-
pre-

== suffixes ==
-ize
-s

== Bound Bases ==
cran-

== Contracted ==
will (they'll / 'll)
is (Tim's / 's)
have (should've \ 've)


== Common Affixes ==

== Third Person Singular ==
When verbs use the -s suffix.

verb + -s
(bakes, walks, hits, etc.)

== Definite vs Indefinite Article ==
English has a class of words known as articles, including the
(the so-called definite article) and a (the so-called indefinite article), as in
the book or a book.

==== Open vs Closed Class Words (content vs function words) ====
The open-class words
are those belonging to the major part-of-speech classes (nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs), which in any language tend to be quite large
and ‘‘open-ended.’’ That is, an unlimited number of new words can be
created and added to these classes (recall floowain/floowainer).

In contrast, closed-class words are those belonging to grammatical, or
function, classes (such as articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, conjunc-
tions, and prepositions), which in any language tend to include a small
number of fixed elements. Function words in English include conjunc-
tions (and, or), articles (the, a), demonstratives (this, that), quantifiers (all,
most, some, few), and prepositions (to, from, at, with).

Example

HAVING WONDERFUL
TIME; HOTEL GREAT; RETURNING FLIGHT 256; SEND
MONEY; STOP. Generally speaking, in telegraphic forms of language
the open-class words are retained, whereas the closed-class words are
omitted wherever possible.

feature analysis—determining which features, properties, or dimensions about our
text best encode its meaning and underlying structure.
