There is (a), the one humans perceive, where is truining is the verb group,
and two others with is as the main verb: in (b) the rest is a gerund (cf. Our
problem is training workers), while in (c) training modifies workers (cf.
Those are training wheels). The last two parses are semantically anoma-
lous, but in most current systems semantic analysis is done only after
syntactic analysis (if at all). This means that, as sentences get longer and
grammars get more comprehensive, such ambiguities lead to a terrible
multiplication of parses. For instance, Martin et al. (1987) report their
system giving 455 parses for the sentence in (1.12):j

(1.12) List the sales of the products produced in 1973 with the products pro-
duced in 1972.
