==== Intro ====
The main goal of Text Analytics is to use Supervised or Unsupervised machine learning to apply labels to a body of text to classify text (meaning, sentiment, etc.).

NLP refers
to a set of techniques involving the application of statistical methods, with or without
insights from linguistics, to understand text for the sake of solving real-world tasks.

This “understanding” of text is mainly derived by transforming texts to useable com‐
putational representations, which are discrete or continuous combinatorial structures
such as vectors or tensors, graphs, and trees.

deep learning algorithms.

==== Supervised Learning ====
Supervision in machine learning, or supervised learning, refers to cases where the
ground truth for the targets (what’s being predicted) is available for the observations.
For example, in document classification, the target is a categorical label, 2 and the
observation is a document. In machine translation, the observation is a sentence in
one language and the target is a sentence in another language.
