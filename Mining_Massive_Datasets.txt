“Bonferroni’s Principle,” a warning against overzealous use
of data mining. More information means less security.



==== Term Frequency Times Inverse Document Frequence (TD.IDF) ====

In several applications of data mining, we shall be faced with the problem of
categorizing documents (sequences of words) by their topic.

For instance, articles about baseball would tend to have many
occurrences of words like “ball,” “bat,” “pitch,”, “run,” and so on.

The most frequent words will
most surely be the common words such as “the” or “and,” which help build
ideas but do not carry any significance themselves. In fact, the several hundred
most common words in English (called stop words) are often removed from
documents before any attempt to classify them.
