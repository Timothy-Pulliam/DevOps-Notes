<setuid0> How do I set up a role with multiple task files?
<setuid0> for example, roles/{tasks1.yml, tasks2.yml}
<agaffney> setuid0: create multiple files under tasks/ and then use import_tasks or include_tasks in tasks/main.yml to include the other tasks files
<setuid0> agaffney: thanks
<setuid0> include_tasks is static and import_tasks is dynamic right?

<agaffney> the other way around
<setuid0> oh. So you would use include_tasks if you were working with variables or templates that were generated during runtime?
<agaffney> you can still do that with a static import. vars referenced in tasks are not evaluated until the task runs
<setuid0> ok, thanks
<agaffney> the differences between include_tasks and import_tasks are relatively minor, and don't matter in most cases
<agaffney> the only time that you *must* use include_tasks is when the path of the file to include uses a variable
<agaffney> and then it's only if it's a variable that's set at runtime

<setuid0> It seems like import_tasks might be slightly faster since it is all done during preprocessing
<setuid0> not sure though
<agaffney> it probably is, but unless you're doing a lot of imports, the difference is probably negligible
