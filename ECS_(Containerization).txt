Elastic Container Service

ECS allows you to manage Docker Containers using API calls and a web interface.

* ECS instances are Regional
* Images are stored in Amazon ECR (Similar to Docker Hub).
* IAM Roles and security groups work on the instance/host level (not at the container or task level)
* IAM with ECS to restrict access
* ECS clusters are groups of of container instances that you can place tasks on. Their are hard and soft limits to how many instances in a cluster.
* Clusters cannot be cross region (although they can be cross AZ)
* Container instances can only be part of one cluster at a time
* ECS agent allows you to connect to an instance in a cluster
